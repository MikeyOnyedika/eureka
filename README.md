# Eureka (incomplete)
A simple note-taking app that uses indexedDB to store all data locally on the browser without need for a remote server or API.

## How to run.
- clone the repo
- `cd` into `eureka`
- open in vscode and run the vscode liveserver extension
- open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` to view the app 

## Todo
This is still a work in progress. I intend to implement
- [ ] searching notes by date, title or description
- [ ] fetch notes by date by default
